# AI Product Factory - Claude Integration Guide

## Overview

The **AI Product Factory** (formerly Titan Workflow Suite) is a sophisticated n8n-based AI orchestration system that automatically generates comprehensive **Product Vision** and **Architecture** documents through multi-phase, collaborative AI agent workflows.

### What It Does

This system uses specialized AI agents working together to:
- Extract technical standards and decisions from existing documentation
- Create detailed Product Vision documents through iterative refinement
- Generate Architecture Vision documents with technical depth
- Validate and audit output quality through adversarial review
- Maintain knowledge graphs and vector embeddings for context retention

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: 5 specialized AI agents (Scavenger, Creator, Critic, Refiner, Auditor)
- **Iterative Refinement**: Adversarial loops that improve output quality through multiple iterations
- **Knowledge Management**: Integration with Graphiti (knowledge graph) and Qdrant (vector database)
- **S3-Compatible Storage**: All artifacts and input documents stored in SeaweedFS (S3-compatible)
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Browser-based file upload with presigned URLs
- **Batch Governance**: Generative UI for approving tech standards (Tech Stack Configurator)
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and scoring mechanisms
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart model selection (GPT-4 for reasoning, GPT-4o-mini for extraction)
- **Dashboard UI**: React-based dashboard with Google OAuth, ADR viewer, and artifact management
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated workflow sync and deployment

### Version

Current version: **v2.7.0** (2026-01-14)

### Activation Steps

#### Option 1: Using Claude CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Add n8n MCP server to user scope (available in all projects)
claude mcp add

# Or add to project scope (only this project)
claude mcp add --scope project
```

Then provide these details when prompted:
- **Server name**: `n8n-mcp`
- **Command**: `npx`
- **Args**: `-y supergateway --streamableHttp https://c3po.etrox.de/mcp-server/http --header "authorization:Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"`

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration

**For Project Scope** (recommended for this repository):

1. **Create `.mcp.json` in project root**:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell (from project root)
   cd C:\Users\180-1\Documents\workspace\curosr-n8n
   notepad .mcp.json
   ```

2. **Paste the configuration** (shown above in MCP Configuration section)

3. **Save the file**

   **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The `.mcp.json` file contains sensitive API keys. A `.gitignore` file has been created to exclude it from version control. Do NOT commit this file to git.

**For User Scope** (available in all projects):

1. **Create/Edit `~/.claude.json`**:
   ```powershell
   # Windows PowerShell
   notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.claude.json
   ```

2. **Add the `mcpServers` section** to your existing config, or create new file with the configuration shown above

3. **Save and close** the file

**After Configuration**:

4. **Restart Claude Code** completely (close all sessions)

5. **Verify Connection**:
   - Start a new conversation with Claude
   - Ask: "What n8n workflows are available?"
   - Claude should list the Titan workflows

### Verification

To test the MCP connection is working:

```powershell
# Test n8n instance accessibility
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://c3po.etrox.de" -Method GET

# Test MCP endpoint (should return workflow list)
# Replace $env:N8N_API_KEY with your actual n8n API token
$headers = @{
    "authorization" = "Bearer $env:N8N_API_KEY"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}
$body = '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://c3po.etrox.de/mcp-server/http" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

## Using Titan with Claude

### Basic Usage

Once MCP is configured, you can interact with Titan workflows naturally through conversation:

#### Example 1: Full Document Generation

```
You: "I need to generate product and architecture documentation for my new
e-commerce platform called 'ShopFast'."

Claude: "Great! Please go to the Dashboard and create a new project:
1. Click 'New Project' on the Projects page
2. Enter project name 'ShopFast'
3. Drag and drop your source documents (architecture docs, requirements, etc.)
4. Click 'Start Project'

The workflow will automatically begin processing your documents."
```

#### Example 2: Quick Vision Document

```
You: "Create just a Product Vision document for a mobile fitness app.
Use the standards we've already extracted."

Claude: [Executes titan-adversarial-loop-subworkflow for vision document]
[Returns refined vision document after 5-10 minutes]
```

#### Example 3: Search Technical Standards

```
You: "What authentication patterns are stored in our knowledge graph?"

Claude: [Executes titan-graphiti-subworkflow with search_facts operation]
[Returns relevant authentication patterns and decisions]
```

### Advanced Usage Patterns

#### Monitoring Long-Running Workflows

```
You: "Start the full Titan workflow for project 'Alpha'. Let me know
when each phase completes."

Claude: [Starts workflow and provides status updates]
- Phase 0: Scavenger completed (3 minutes)
- Phase 1: Vision Loop completed (8 minutes, 3 iterations, score 9.2)
- Phase 2: Architecture Loop in progress...
```

#### Querying Context During Execution

```
You: "While that runs, what technical standards did the Scavenger find?"

Claude: [Queries Graphiti for extracted standards while main workflow continues]
```

#### Custom Parameters

```
You: "Run Titan for project 'Beta' with focus on microservices architecture
and event-driven patterns."

Claude: [Includes your architectural preferences in the workflow input]
```

### Best Practices

1. **Provide Clear Project Context**: The more detail you give about your project, the better the output quality
2. **Use Descriptive Project Names**: Makes it easier to track and reference later
3. **Upload Quality Documents**: Include architecture docs, requirements, and technical standards
4. **Monitor Costs**: Each full run costs $1.50-$3.00 in OpenAI API usage
5. **Review Intermediate Outputs**: Check Scavenger results before continuing to ensure accurate standard extraction
6. **Iterate on Results**: Use the Adversarial Loop directly to refine specific sections

### Combining MCP Capabilities

You can leverage multiple MCP servers together for enhanced workflows:

**Enhanced Document Generation**:
```
You: "Use Exa to research best practices for microservices architecture,
then use that research as context for generating an Architecture Vision
document using the Titan workflow for project 'MicroserviceApp'."
```

**Security-Enhanced Workflow**:
```
You: "After generating the architecture document, use Semgrep to scan
the codebase for security vulnerabilities and include findings in the
technical standards."
```

**Web Research Integration**:
```
You: "Use Firecrawl to extract technical documentation from [company website],
store it in the Titan knowledge graph, then generate architecture docs
that align with their standards."
```

**Automated Testing Integration**:
```
You: "Generate the product vision using Titan, then use Playwright to
create automated UI tests based on the documented user flows."
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Connection Issues

#### Problem: "n8n-mcp server not responding"

**Symptoms**: Claude says it can't connect to n8n or workflows aren't visible

**Solutions**:
1. Verify n8n instance is accessible:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://c3po.etrox.de" -Method GET
   ```

2. Check MCP is enabled in n8n:
   - Login to n8n at https://c3po.etrox.de
   - Go to Settings → Instance-level MCP
   - Ensure "Enable MCP access" is toggled ON

3. Verify token hasn't expired:
   - Generate a new MCP Access Token in n8n settings
   - Update the token in your `.mcp.json` (project) or `~/.claude.json` (user) file
   - Restart Claude Code

4. Check firewall/network:
   - Ensure your firewall allows outbound HTTPS to c3po.etrox.de
   - Try from a different network if corporate firewall is blocking

#### Problem: "Workflow not found" or "No workflows available"

**Solutions**:
1. Mark workflows as "Available in MCP":
   - Open each Titan workflow in n8n
   - Enable the "Available in MCP" toggle
   - Save the workflow

2. Ensure workflows have compatible triggers:
   - Titan workflows use Chat Triggers (supported by MCP)
   - Webhook and Schedule triggers are also supported

3. Restart the MCP server:
   - Restart Claude Code completely (close all sessions)
   - Wait 10-15 seconds for MCP initialization

### Workflow Execution Errors

#### Problem: "Credential not found: OpenAI API"

**Solution**: Create credentials with exact names:
- `OpenAI API` for AI Agent nodes
- `OpenAI API Header` for Qdrant embedding generation
- Names must match exactly (case-sensitive)

#### Problem: "Validation Error: Missing input files"

**Solution**: Ensure your project has uploaded input files. Create projects through the Dashboard:
1. Go to `/projects/new`
2. Enter project name
3. Upload at least one document (drag-and-drop)
4. Click "Start Project"

The workflow requires at least one input file in S3 storage.

#### Problem: "Graphiti connection refused"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Graphiti is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://graphiti:8000/health
   # or
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. Check `GRAPHITI_URL` environment variable in n8n

3. Ensure n8n can reach Graphiti:
   - If using Docker, both containers must be on same network
   - If using external Graphiti, ensure network connectivity

#### Problem: "Qdrant authentication failed"

**Solutions**:
1. If Qdrant has authentication enabled:
   - Set `QDRANT_API_KEY` environment variable in n8n
   - Qdrant workflow uses `api-key` header (not Authorization)

2. If Qdrant doesn't have auth:
   - Remove or leave empty the `QDRANT_API_KEY` variable
   - Workflow will work without authentication

#### Problem: "Embedding generation failed"

**Solution**:
1. Verify `OpenAI API Header` credential is configured:
   - Header Name: `Authorization`
   - Header Value: `Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. Check OpenAI API key has sufficient credits

3. Verify API key has access to `text-embedding-3-small` model

#### Problem: "Subworkflow returns no data"

**Solution**: This was fixed in v2.2.0. Ensure you're using the latest workflows:
- All subworkflows now have proper `Merge Output` nodes
- Re-import workflow files if you have older versions
- Verify all subworkflows are marked "Active"

### Performance Issues

#### Problem: Workflow takes longer than expected (>45 minutes)

**Possible Causes**:
1. **High OpenAI API latency**: Check OpenAI status page
2. **Many iterations in adversarial loop**: Critic is giving low scores
3. **Large document corpus**: Scavenger processing many files
4. **Network latency**: Slow connection to Graphiti/Qdrant

**Solutions**:
- Monitor iteration counts in workflow execution logs
- Reduce max iterations in adversarial loop (default: 5)
- Use faster models (GPT-4o-mini) for non-critical agents
- Optimize document corpus (remove unnecessary files)

#### Problem: High OpenAI API costs

**Solutions**:
1. **Use GPT-4o-mini for all agents**: ~95% cost reduction
   - Edit each agent node to use `gpt-4o-mini` model
   - Accept slightly lower quality output

2. **Reduce iteration limits**:
   - Lower max iterations from 5 to 3 in adversarial loop
   - Increase quality threshold from 9.0 to 8.5

3. **Batch multiple projects**:
   - Process multiple related projects together
   - Reuse knowledge graph context

4. **Monitor token usage**:
   - Check workflow telemetry for token counts
   - Reduce prompt sizes if needed

## AI Product Factory - Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

The **AI Product Factory** is an advanced workflow system that builds on Titan's patterns to provide a fully human-in-the-loop product development lifecycle. It features multi-model agent routing, state-aware resumability, and strict tech governance.

### Key Differences from Titan

| Feature | Titan | AI Product Factory |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Storage** | Google Drive | S3/SeaweedFS (cloud-independent) |
| **Model Routing** | Single provider (OpenRouter) | Multi-model via OpenRouter (Claude + GPT-4o + Perplexity) |
| **Human Interaction** | Checkpoints only | Batch governance UI (Tech Stack Configurator) |
| **Resumability** | Manual | Automatic state persistence with Smart Start |
| **Research** | None | Perplexity Sonar for fact-checking and risk research |
| **Score Threshold** | 0-10 scale | 0-100 scale (more granular) |
| **File Upload** | External (Google Drive) | Integrated drag-and-drop with presigned URLs |

### AI Product Factory Workflows

#### 1. Main Orchestrator

**File**: `ai-product-factory-main-workflow.json`

**Entry Point**: Chat Trigger with file upload support

**Smart Start Features**:
- Greeting on empty conversation
- Project creation via Dashboard UI
- "Resume" keyword detection
- Project state persistence in S3 and PostgreSQL

#### 2. Context Scavenging (Phase 0)

**File**: `ai-product-factory-scavenging-subworkflow.json`

**Features**:
- Document batch processing from S3 input folder
- Technical standard extraction with Claude
- **Batch Governance UI**: GovernanceWidget renders in chat for bulk approval
- Perplexity enrichment with 3 alternatives per technology
- Graphiti and Qdrant storage with scope metadata

**Governance Payload** (sent to Dashboard):
```json
{
  "type": "governance_request",
  "scavenging_id": "sc_abc123",
  "project_id": "myproject",
  "detected_stack": [
    {
      "id": "tech_001",
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "type": "technology",
      "category": "database",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "alternatives": [
        { "name": "MySQL", "description": "Alternative RDBMS" },
        { "name": "CockroachDB", "description": "Distributed SQL" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "webhook_url": "https://n8n.example.com/webhook/governance-batch"
}
```

#### 3. Vision Adversarial Loop (Phase 1)

**File**: `ai-product-factory-vision-loop-subworkflow.json`

**Adversarial Pattern**:
1. **Visionary** (Claude) → Creates Product Vision draft
2. **Critic** (GPT-4o) → Evaluates with Perplexity fact-checking
3. **Refiner** (Claude) → Improves based on feedback
4. Iterates until score >= 90 or max iterations (5)

**Circuit Breaker**: After 5 iterations, asks human for guidance:
- Accept current version
- Provide specific guidance
- Lower threshold
- Start over

#### 4. Architecture Adversarial Loop (Phase 2)

**File**: `ai-product-factory-architecture-loop-subworkflow.json`

**Enhanced Pattern**:
1. **Architect** (Claude) → Creates ARC42 document
2. **Dr. Doom** (GPT-4o) → Pre-mortem risk analysis
3. **Fixer** (Perplexity) → Researches mitigation for flagged risks
4. **Refiner** (Claude) → Applies fixes and improvements
5. Iterates until score >= 90

**Tech Stack Compliance**: Architect MUST use only approved technologies from Graphiti.

#### 5. Perplexity Research Tool

**File**: `ai-product-factory-perplexity-research-subworkflow.json`

**Research Types**:
- `fact_check`: Verify claims with sources
- `market_research`: Market trends and data
- `best_practices`: Industry best practices
- `risk_mitigation`: Mitigation strategies
- `competitive_analysis`: Competitor intelligence

#### 6. Decision Logger

**File**: `ai-product-factory-decision-logger-subworkflow.json`

**Operations**:
- `log_decision`: Tech standard discoveries
- `log_iteration`: Adversarial loop iterations
- `log_approval`: Human approvals

2. Enter project name (e.g., "ShopFast")
3. Optionally add a description
4. Drag and drop your source documents (PDF, MD, DOCX, TXT)
5. Click "Start Project"
6. The workflow automatically begins processing

**Via API**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://dashboard.example.com/api/start-project \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectName": "ShopFast",
    "projectId": "shopfast-abc123",
    "description": "E-commerce platform",
    "inputFiles": [
      { "key": "projects/shopfast/input/requirements.pdf", "name": "requirements.pdf", "size": 245000, "contentType": "application/pdf" }
    ]
  }'
```

#### Tech Standard Approval Flow (Batch Governance)

When Phase 0 discovers tech standards, a **GovernanceWidget** appears in the chat:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Tech Stack Configurator - ShopFast                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Name         │ Category  │ Source              │ Confidence│
│  PostgreSQL   │ database  │ architecture.md     │ 95%       │
│    └─ Alternatives: MySQL, CockroachDB, SQLite              │
│  React        │ framework │ tech-standards.md   │ 92%       │
│    └─ Alternatives: Vue, Svelte, Angular                    │
│  TypeScript   │ language  │ coding-standards.md │ 98%       │
│    └─ Alternatives: JavaScript, Flow                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Approve All (Global)] [Approve All (Local)] [Skip All]    │
│                                        [Confirm Selections] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Users can:
- Select alternatives from the dropdown for each technology
- Choose scope: Global (all projects) or Local (this project only)
- Skip technologies they don't want to approve
- Use batch actions for quick approval

#### Resuming a Project

```
User: "Resume"

AI: "Found existing project: **ShopFast**

     Current Status:
     - Phase: 1 - Product Vision Loop
     - Status: in_progress
     - Last Score: 78/100

     Would you like to:

### Modifying Workflows

#### Editing Agent Behavior

To customize agent prompts:

1. **Read the current prompts**: See `workflows/TITAN_AGENT_PROMPTS.md`
2. **Edit in n8n**:
   - Open the workflow containing the agent
   - Find the "AI Agent" node for that agent
   - Modify the "System Message" field
   - Save and test
3. **Document changes**: Update `TITAN_AGENT_PROMPTS.md` with your changes

#### Adding New Agents

1. **Create AI Agent node** in n8n
2. **Configure model**:
   - Choose appropriate model (GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Opus)
   - Set temperature (0.2 for analytical, 0.7 for creative)
3. **Add memory** (if needed):
   - Window Buffer Memory for conversation context
   - Simple Memory for stateless operations
4. **Attach tools** (optional):
   - Connect Graphiti subworkflow as a tool
   - Connect Qdrant subworkflow as a tool
5. **Test independently** before integrating

#### Modifying Workflow Logic

Common modifications:

**Change iteration limits**:
- Edit "Increment Iteration" node in adversarial loop
- Modify the `maxIterations` variable (default: 5)

**Adjust quality thresholds**:
- Edit "Check Score" node in adversarial loop
- Modify the score comparison (default: ≥ 9.0)

**Add checkpoints**:
- Insert Wait nodes for user confirmation
- Useful for reviewing intermediate outputs

**Change model selection**:
- Edit "Chat Model" nodes in each agent
- Switch between GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini, or Claude Opus

### Testing Changes

Follow the comprehensive testing checklist in `workflows/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`:

#### Unit Tests (Individual Components)
1. Test each subworkflow independently
2. Verify input validation logic
3. Check error handling paths
4. Validate output format

#### Integration Tests (Full Workflow)
1. Run complete workflow with test data
2. Monitor execution logs for errors
3. Verify all phases complete successfully
4. Check output quality

#### Regression Tests (After Changes)
1. Run test suite from `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Compare outputs with baseline
3. Verify no degradation in quality scores
4. Check execution time hasn't increased significantly

## Cost & Performance Metrics

### API Cost Breakdown (per full workflow run)

| Component | Model | Est. Tokens | Cost |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------|
| **Scavenger** | Claude Sonnet 3.5 | 10K input + 5K output | $0.005 |
| **Creator** (3 iterations) | Claude Sonnet 3.5 | 30K input + 15K output | $0.022 |
| **Critic** (3 iterations) | Claude Sonnet 3.5 | 20K input + 5K output | $0.015 |
| **Refiner** (3 iterations) | Claude Sonnet 3.5 | 40K input + 20K output | $0.033 |
| **Auditor** | Claude Sonnet 3.5 | 15K input + 5K output | $0.010 |
| **Embeddings** | text-embedding-3-small | 50K tokens | $0.001 |
| **Total** | | | **~$0.10** |

**Cost Optimization**:
- Using Claude Haiku for Scavenger/Auditor: **~$0.06 per run** (40% cost reduction)
- Limiting to 2 iterations: **~$0.07 per run** (30% cost reduction)
- Enable prompt caching: Up to 90% savings on repeated system prompts

### Performance Benchmarks

**Typical Execution Times**:
- **Phase 0 (Scavenger)**: 2-5 minutes
  - Depends on: Number of documents, document size
- **Phase 1 (Vision)**: 5-15 minutes
  - Depends on: Iterations needed (typically 2-3), model speed
- **Phase 2 (Architecture)**: 5-15 minutes
  - Depends on: Iterations needed (typically 2-3), model speed
- **Phase 3 (Audit)**: 1-3 minutes
  - Depends on: Document size, complexity validation

**Quality Metrics**:
- **Average iterations to convergence**: 2.8 (Phase 1), 2.5 (Phase 2)
- **Final quality scores**: 9.0-9.8 (out of 10)
- **Success rate**: 98% (reaches quality threshold within 5 iterations)

**Throughput**:
- **Sequential processing**: 1 project per 15-40 minutes
- **Parallel processing**: Up to 5 projects simultaneously (with sufficient API rate limits)

## Security Considerations

### MCP Token Security

**API Keys in MCP Configuration**:

The MCP configuration includes several API keys that provide access to external services:

| Service | Key Type | Access Level | Security Priority |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **n8n** | JWT Token | Full API access to workflows | 🔴 Critical |
| **Firecrawl** | API Key | Web scraping credits | 🟡 Medium |
| **Exa** | API Key | Search API usage | 🟡 Medium |
| **Perplexity** | API Key | AI search credits | 🟡 Medium |
| **Ref** | API Key | Documentation access | 🟢 Low |

**Security Best Practices**:

- **Do not commit** `.mcp.json` with tokens to version control (add to `.gitignore`)
- **Rotate tokens regularly** (recommended: every 90 days)
- **Use environment-specific tokens** for development vs production
- **Revoke immediately** if any token is compromised
- **Prefer user-scoped config** (`~/.claude.json`) to keep tokens out of repositories
- **Monitor API usage** for all services to detect unauthorized access
- **Set billing alerts** on services that charge per usage (Firecrawl, Exa, Perplexity)

### API Key Management

- Store OpenAI API keys in n8n credentials (encrypted at rest)
- Use separate API keys for different environments
- Monitor API usage in OpenAI dashboard
- Set up billing alerts to prevent unexpected charges

### Data Privacy

- Documents processed by Titan are sent to OpenAI API
- Embeddings are stored in Qdrant (ensure proper access controls)
- Knowledge graph data in Graphiti (ensure proper access controls)
- Input documents stored in S3/SeaweedFS (ensure bucket policies are configured)

### Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions to service accounts
2. **Audit Logs**: Review n8n execution logs regularly
3. **Secure Communications**: Always use HTTPS for n8n instance
4. **Input Validation**: Titan workflows validate inputs, but verify source data
5. **Output Sanitization**: Review generated documents before sharing externally
